#### If the user has any reason to stop the countdown, they may fill out the required fields. The questions ensure that the user has a resonable explanation to stopping the timer prematurely, and give them some time to think about their decision.

#### While the countdown timer is running, selected websites will be inaccessable in normal and private browsing modes. Once the timer ends, refresh the page and the website will become accessible.
